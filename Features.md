Easily Find Cliparts from the Internet

Pencil has a clipart browser tool that integrates with [OpenClipart.org](http://openclipart.org/) to let users easily find cliparts by keywords and added them into the drawing by a simple drag-and-drop operation.

Inter-page linking
---
Elements in a drawing can be linked to a specific page in the same document. This helps user define the UI flow when creating application or website mockups.

Linkings defined in a document are converted into HTML hyper-links when the document is exported into web format. This process creates an interactive version of the mockup in which viewers can see a simulated flow when clicking on the UI elements.
